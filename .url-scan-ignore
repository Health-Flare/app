# .url-scan-ignore
#
# Whitelist for scripts/check_urls.sh.
# Each non-blank, non-comment line is a grep -E pattern that suppresses a
# specific false positive in the URL scan.
#
# Format:
#   <grep -E pattern>   # Justification: <why this URL is acceptable>
#
# Rules:
#   - Every entry MUST have an inline justification comment.
#   - Patterns should be as specific as possible (avoid broad wildcards).
#   - Reviewed as part of any PR that adds a new entry.
#
# Currently no whitelisted patterns — the codebase is clean.
